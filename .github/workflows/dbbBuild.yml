# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Demo-DBB_Build_on_ZOS_With_GithubActions_SSH
## Notes:
# A sample z/OS DBB workflow using GitHub Actions (GHA) with SSH connection

# Global vars
env:
  # SSH connection information
  DBB_Host: 'ssh baljeet@tvt6031.svl.ibm.com' # A valid SSH account on Z. With pre-generated and tested keys in the runner.

  # Pipeline scripts on z/OS (relative to the SSH user's Home Dir in USS)
  Clone: 'ghActions/All-pipeline-scripts/git-clone-ssh.sh' # Script to clone the code from GitHub to z/OS 
  DBB_Build: 'ghActions/All-pipeline-scripts/dbb-build.sh' # Script to perform the DBB build on z/OS

# "on" trigger to manually start this workflow. Can add "pull, push..." for auto trigger.
# see https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/contexts
